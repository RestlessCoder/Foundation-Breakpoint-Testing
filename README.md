# Foundation 6.6.1 Sass Breakpoint Error

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

npm install to get all the dependencies (package.json is provided)

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```

Finally, run `gulp default` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file(app.scss).
